This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Because credit card fraud causes major financial losses, it is crucial for companies to identify suspicious patterns quickly. Our model analyzes transaction behaviors to classify legitimate and fraudulent activity with high accuracy.
